## Design 

- The design of the website has the goal to inspire the user to be creative with their craft. The visitor should feel that the clean look and clear messages on the site are inviting and friendly, as well as professional. As a working or aspiring musician, the user should feel that one is welcomed into an environment that lets You create freely and comfortably. 

### Choice of colours

- A careful palette of colours have been used to provide maximum accessibility, while maintaining the professional feel of the website. The user can enjoy an experience which is smooth on the eye and also clearly displays the message of the site. On the landing page, both green and red are used as background colours for the sections with text. The green resembles the soothing feeling You get when accomplishing Your goal, as well as indicating the project has been "greenlit". The red is a good complement to the green, and indicate both importance and a bit of urgency. It also suits the background well, given a slightly transparant character.

### Choice of fonts

- The site utilizes some well known sans-serif fonts. The choice of these fonts was based on the goal to provide maximum readability and a professional feel - more ecclectic fonts may sometimes confuse a user or provide a less serious feel. Fonts such as 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva and Verdana, sans-serif, are fonts which are very easily accessible and translates well on most devices and screens. 

## Wireframes

- The wireframes produced with Balsamiq.
