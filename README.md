## Design 

The design of the website has the goal to inspire the user to be creative with their craft. The visitor should feel that the clean look and clear messages on the site are inviting and friendly, as well as professional. As a working or aspiring musician, You should feel that You are welcomed into an anvironment that lets You create freely and comfortably. 

### Choice of colours

A careful choice of colours have been used to provide maximum accessibility, while maintaining the professional feel of the website. The user can enjoy an experience which is smooth on the eye and also clearly displays the message of the site. When clicking on the links, the user will feel that You are still on the same site, so the colour palette is homogenous and balanced.

### Choice of fonts

Some clean sans-serif fonts were used to provide a readable text. The choice of these fonts was based on the goal to provide maximum readability and a professional feel. More ecclectic fonts may sometimes confuse a user or provide a less serious feel.

## Wireframes

The wireframes produced with Balsamiq.
